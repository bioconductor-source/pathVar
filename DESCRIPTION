Title: Methods to Find Pathways with Significantly Different
        Variability

Description: This package contains the functions to find the pathways
        that have significantly different variability than a reference
        gene set. It also finds the categories from this pathway that
        are significant where each category is a cluster of genes. The
        genes are separated into clusters by their level of
        variability.
